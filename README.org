* Iframe-Anti-Scrolljack
This is a node module which, when run, will test if the current document is inside an iframe. 

If it is, then any scroll events on the parent document will temporarily disable all pointer events for that iframe.

Pointer events will be restored 500ms after the most recent scroll event.

** Browser Compatibility
Compatible with standards-compliant browsers and Internet Explorer 9+ (due to use of addEventListener).
